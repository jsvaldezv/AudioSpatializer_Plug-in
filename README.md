Panning has been an important tool in music production. Nowadays it is common to see arrangements of 5, 8, 16 or more speakers giving the need to create audio effects for all these arrangements. This work shows the development of a plug-in with C ++ and the JUCE framework based on sound modeling formulas and music theory.

For the development of the stereo configuration, the Constant Power Panning formulas were used due to the precision and auditory fidelity they have to represent the behavior of the sound when passing from one speaker to another.

The equation obtained from the analysis of the sine and cosine functions was developed to be applied for the configuration of 4 channels / horns, there are 2 sliders that modify the values of X and Y depending on where you want to position the sound. These values alter the result of the following 4 equations for each speaker.
